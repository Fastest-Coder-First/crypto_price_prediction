# Dissertation project - COMP30030 3rd year project 

Abstract

The purpose of this project is to analyse peoplesâ€™ sentiment towards cryptocurrencies extracted from Twitter posts and predict market price movements. In the present day, mass public reactions can be depicted from social media channels. Especially, Twitter has become one of the mainstream social media platforms for user-generated content (Abbasi, et al., 2014). 
Cryptocurrencies have become a popular topic for millions of people in the last 5 years due to unprecedented returns. Further, there is an increase of young amateur investors in cryptocurrencies each day. A particular interest for this project is identifying to what extent amateur investors are driven by fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) in buying cryptocurrency assets. In the financial trading world, FOMO refers to the fear that an investor feels when missing out on a potentially profitable investment (Samuelsson, 2022).
